# Todo Component

## Purpose of the todo component
The purpose of the todo component is for a showcase that the API are almost the same as the API of [http://nooku.org](Nooku)  
And to show a working solution using Raddish.

Because Raddish only returns data there are no templates, this can be done with Ember or Angular.

## Component Config
By using the component config almost no extra files/ objects have to be created,
and the getting of these values happens completely automatically.
